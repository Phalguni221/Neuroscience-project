//Inspirtation for application
* love for neuroscience inspired me to create this scientific based website. 
* I hope to use the skills that I have learned in this bootcamp to create and efficient website where people will have access to neuroscience basics to advancements in neuroscience technology at their fingertips. 
* Plan on introducing this particular scientific field through the form of articles.

//How to Use Application
* This app is designed as a simple website. 
* Users can log in online and use it using their mouse to click on certain navbar links. 
* Can register as a user by typing their information in the login page. 
* Brain games can be played with a simple cursor and keyboard. 
* Users can use tabs to access different webpages. 
* This website is an SPA.
* All pages are presented as different sections that can be accessed by the appropriate tabs on the same page. 

//Tech used to Create APP
* This app was created using MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, Node.JS).
* Two collections were created in the MongoDB database "Neurostyle". 
* Mongoose connects Node.JS to MongoDB and allows the information stored to be presented in the server. 
* The app utilizes back-end for presentation. 
* Information travels from the back-end to the sevrer to finally the front-end that users can use and access.

//Bugs or Unfinished functionality 

* As of now, trying to fix the login page. However, experiencing issues with webpack polyfill. 

* Updated: I am trying to make the back-end appear for all pages and am also finalizing layout details.

* Updated: Trying to deploy working app to Heroku.
