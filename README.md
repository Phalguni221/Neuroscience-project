# Neuroscience-project

//Inspirtation for application
    My love for neuroscience inspired me to create this scientific based website. I hope to use the skills that I have learned in this bootcamp to create and efficient website where people will have access to neuroscience basics to advancements in neuroscience technology at their fingertips. I plan on introducing this particular scientific field through the form of articles.

//How to Use Application
This app is designed as a simple website. Users can log in online and use it using their mouse to click on certain navbar links. They can register as a user by typing their information in the login page. Brain games can be played with a simple cursor and keyboard. 

//Tech used to Create APP
This app was created using React for front-end and Node.js for back-end.

//Bugs or Unfinished functionality 

As of now, trying to fix the login page. However, experiencing issues with webpack polyfill.
